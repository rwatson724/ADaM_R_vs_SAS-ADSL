Code was developed based on the environments and platforms the authors, Joshua Cook and Richann Jean Watson, had available at the time. Code is not guaranteed to work on all environments and platforms. You are free to use the code and modify to fit your needs. We ask that you just cite where you got the original code from. If you have any questions or need help with some of the logic feel free to contact Joshua Cook at jcook0312@outlook.com or Richann Jean Watson at richann.watson@datarichconsulting.com.

Paper coming soon...
